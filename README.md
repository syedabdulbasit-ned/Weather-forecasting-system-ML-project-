This project explores the application of supervised machine learning techniques to a weather 
classification problem using a structured dataset. The dataset contains weather summary observations, 
with each record labeled as one of three classes: Clear, Foggy, or Overcast. Each instance includes a set 
of meteorological features (such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) which serve as input 
variables to classify the weather summary 
Model Implementation: A total of five different machine learning algorithms were implemented: 
• A non-parametric algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),Decision tree ,SVM 
• A parametric shallow algorithm: Logistic Regression 
• A neural network-based approach: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
